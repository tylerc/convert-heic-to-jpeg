Convert HEIC to JPEG
====================

A Windows UWP Application that converts HEIC images to JPEG. It's my first ever UWP app in the Windows Store!
(submission still pending as of 2020-03-30)

Building
--------

Grab a copy of Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition and open up the solution file.

It should build without any issues, as it relies only on core Windows 10 UWP APIs. No external dependencies.

This was heavily inspired by: https://github.com/DavidAnson/ConvertTo-Jpeg
